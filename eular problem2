Problem2:
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


Solution:
c = 0

a=1
b=2

sum=2

while c < 4000000:
# calculate fib
	c = a +b
	a = b
	b = c

	if c%2 == 0:
		sum += c

print('the result is:',sum)
